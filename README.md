#Project description
This project was a JavaScript challenge I made based on the PokeApi (Pokemon API) where we had to show some pokemons on the home screen and just below them there were two buttons, one took you to where you could search for the pokemon by name or ID and another where you searched for pok√©mons by type, when the search was done by type if you clicked on a pok√©mon you were redirected to another screen with details of that pok√©mon, Made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
